# introduction-and-disclaimer

Hello! This is my first time putting any of my work on a public repository, and I'm pretty new and inexperienced with programming, 
so I'll probably have a lot of mistakes in here.
So, feel free to put in your criticism of my program somewhere. Just be nice about it.

Hello, I'm XnossisX. I work mostly in JavaScript and C++, and for some practice, I decided to start making a programming language 
(It's called Tree, hence the name).

This program in particular is intended to be an interpreter for bytecode that will be created from compiling Tree.
The project is not done yet, and there should be regular edits from me.

# Installation

To install, download the files, and then compile from treeEx.cpp.

To run any programs, including the sample programs included, use a .tree extension, and make sure to set the automatic file opener on Windows to your executable outputted from compilation.
