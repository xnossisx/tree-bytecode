# Introduction and disclaimer

Hello! This is my first time putting any of my work on my own public repository, and I'm pretty inexperienced, so this program isn't of the high quality. Therefore, feel free to criticize it, but please be respectful.

Anyways, I'm XnossisX. I work mostly in Java and C++ these days, and for some practice, I decided to start making a programming language called Tree, whose main feature is that it is "event-oriented", meaning that it would theoretically be most suitable for programming applications.

This program is intended to be an interpreter for bytecode that will be created from compiling Tree code. It is not done yet, so there *should* be regular edits from me. Most of the details about the structure bytecode are unwritten at the moment, but the basics can be gleaned from some of the comments that I have put in the source code.

# Installation

To install, download the files, and then compile from treeEx.cpp. Sample programs use the .tree extension.
